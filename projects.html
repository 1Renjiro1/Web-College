              In a galaxy far away, galactic control fight aliens to save the
              universe from doom. A war fought throughout the years. It is now
              your time to fight. It is your job to save the universe from the
              evil aliens and claim the universe in humanities name.
                        
              This story is very simple and not overcomplicated this is because
              of the target audience and the right length to keep people of the
              age group engaged with the story and game. It also sounds like
              Star Wars which is commonly associated as one of the biggest space
              movies.                
              
              My main scene will be set in space with orbiting planets to add
              life to the scene which can apply to the target audience as it
              would grab their attention rather than having them as stationary.
              The time-period is going to be set in the distant future as I want
              it to have that futuristic feel to it.

              My requirement for the game is to make a fully working third
              person space shooter with a balanced controller for the spaceship.
              The target audience for the game is 5 or over this means that I
              will need to target my advertising towards the parents of the
              child therefore, bright colours will be a good idea as it is more
              appealing towards that age group as it shows it is child friendly.

              I am also targeting this game more towards PC this is because it
              will be easier to understand how the game works and its
              functionality compared to if it was on console or PC.

              The core gameplay is to destroy enemies that will spawn in waves
              and target the player for which they must destroy and get points
              in the game the more powerful the enemies are the more points you
              will claim. The rewards have no purpose other than to give the
              player feedback.

              I made my game goals this way because I want it to be simple for
              my target audience.

            The key game mechanics is that enemies will spawn in waves and
            target the player. The player actions will have a custom-made
            controller for the spaceship which is inspired by the YouTuber Kyle
            Rasmusson UE4 Scripting Jet Movement however, I am planning to make
            tweaks to it to give it a more fun interaction. The player will also
            use mouse button 1 to shoot the bullet this once again will have to
            be made from scratch but inspired by Royal Skies How to Make
            Bullets.
